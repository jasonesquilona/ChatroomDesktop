# Goals
- Create a Server Client Model Chatroom Service, that would have the server managing any communication between Users and the chat rooms
- Learn more about how C# works with Networks and Databases (in this project a LocalDB Server as used)
- Learn and Improv on my knowledge on how Model-View architectural pattern works (in this one a M-V-P was used)
- Learning how multi-threading works in C# and improving my understanding how multi-threading works in general

# Learnings/Challenges

## File Organization and Project Organization
As I slowly did this project and it kept increasing in scale and complexity, I found that I was having a lot of trouble navigating my project and keep plan of things. I also used a project planner (Trello ,etc) to help with my organization, this helped a bit but I would need to be more detailed in my Tasks descriptions so I can have a better focus on where to take my project. While I believe my variables were detailed and gave context to what is the purpose of each variable, I had a tendency to have a similar but different name of variables in between files, this would also confuse me and make me more disorganized. In future projects I would better plan using Rough Drafts and better planning as well as working on having cleaner code to ensure that I am more organized and have a better idea of where my focus each time I am sitting down to code

## Getting More Comfortable and Adopting with a Test Driven Approach
A Test Driven Approach is how I tend to do my projects back in school and when i worked at my co-op. 
This project I didn't know how to approach a Test Driven Development Approach, it really bit me and affected my progress while refactoring, which led to burnout on this side project. As I encountered, this problem, I decided to do more research to see how I can approach it.
I was slow implementing unit test in this project and I wasnt able to implement unit test based on network related stuff. In my future side projects and any projects I encounter in my career, I aim to be more aggressive testing and approach it from the very start of my project.

## Being Too Ambitious with the Project Idea
This project albeit fun and really engaged and challenged my problem solving skills, was a slog to get through. I kept getting too many ideas and kept making it bigger and bigger than I expected it to be at the start. This led to burnout and overall having this project take a longer than expected for me to complete. I would definitely want to do these projects of this size and magnitude in the future (and hopefully bigger) but I learned that I would need to do other smaller side projects (i.e, learn new skills and catch up with the current landscape of technology) in between to make sure I can get a breathe of fresh air.

# Things to do in my next project
- Use Branches and Pull Requests for better Revision Control (I know how to do this just best to implement best practice even when working solo)
- Test Driven Approach to Development
- Learn more (Start reading books and blogs, keep up on improving)

# Areas of Improvement
- Code Cleanliness
- Better Unit Testing and learning how to create more powerful unit tests
- Implement more testing 
- Better Comments to improve readability
- Improve planning when it comes to implementing new features
- Expand and continue learning on how to make better OOP code

# Future Improvements
- Better handling of Closing App and ensuring all threads are closed properly upon closure
- Introducing a log out button and a back out of chatroom button so users dont have to relog to join another chat room
- Improve UI and smoothness of User Experience
- Add more tests
- Refactor code to clean up file orginzation and reuse code
