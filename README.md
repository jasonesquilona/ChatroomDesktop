## Getting More Comfortable and Adopting with a Test Driven Approach
A Test Driven Approach is how I tend to do my projects back in school and when i worked at my co-op. 
This project I didn't know how to approach a Test Driven Development Approach, it really bit me and affected my progress while refactoring, which led to burnout on this side project. As I encountered, this problem, I decided to do more research to see how I can approach it.
I was slow implementing unit test in this project and I wasnt able to implement unit test based on network related stuff. In my future side projects and any projects I encounter in my career, I aim to be more aggressive testing and approach it from the very start of my project.

# Things to do in my next project
- Use Branches and Pull Requests for better Revision Control (I know how to do this just best to implement best practice even when working solo)
- Test Driven Approach to Development
- Learn more (Start reading books and blogs, keep up on improving)

# Areas of Improvement
- Code Cleanliness
- Better Unit Testing and learning how to create more powerful unit tests
- Better Comments to improve readability
- Improve planning when it comes to implementing new features
- Expand on learning how to make better OOP code
