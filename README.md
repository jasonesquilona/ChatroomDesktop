# Learnings

## Getting More Comfortable and Adopting with a Test Driven Approach
A Test Driven Approach is how I tend to do my projects back in school and when i worked at my co-op. 
This project I didn't know how to approach a Test Driven Development Approach, it really bit me and affected my progress while refactoring, which led to burnout on this side project. As I encountered, this problem, I decided to do more research to see how I can approach it.
I was slow implementing unit test in this project and I wasnt able to implement unit test based on network related stuff. In my future side projects and any projects I encounter in my career, I aim to be more aggressive testing and approach it from the very start of my project.


# Areas of Improvement

Better Unit Testing and learning how to create more powerful unit tests
